# LuLuu

A cute and smart arm-warmer sleeve with a 1.3" full color TFT display built into the back of the
hand.

Runs on an RP2040 with built-in battery management and micro SD card storage plus direct connection
to an Adafruit 1.3" TFT. Also allows easy connection to Adafruit STEMMA QT I2C sensors and
implements the RaspberryPi 3-wire debug protocol for ARM SWD serial-wire debugging and RS232-style
UART communication.
