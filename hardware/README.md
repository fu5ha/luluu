# Hardware

The main part of this folder is the [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) project for the main PCB. Open it with KiCad v7+.
There are production files for PCB production and assembly from JLCPCB in the `production/` folder. There is also a
small 3d printed "front panel" part with exported STL files in the `FrontPanel/` folder.

TODO: document BOM, assembly process, etc more

## Front Panel

The front panel part was designed in OnShape. The exported files (printed at JLCPCB in my case but could be printed on
any 3d printer really) can be found in the `FrontPanel/` folder. The original OnShape document can be viewed and
remixed here:
