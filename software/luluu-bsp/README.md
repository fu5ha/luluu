# `luluu-bsp` - Board Support for the LuLuu!

You should include this crate if you are writing code that you want to run on
the LuLuu! board.

This crate includes the [rp2040-hal], but also configures each pin of the
RP2040 chip according to how it is connected up on the LuLuu.

The layout of the LuLuu! is intentionally very similar to the
[Adafruit Feather RP2040].
